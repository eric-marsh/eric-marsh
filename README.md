## Howdy! I'm Eric! Welcome to my github profile! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Fullstack Software Engineer** with 6+ years of experience. I specialize in **React, TypeScript and Next.js**. I am particularly passionate about user experience! As an internet user my whole life, I know a good website from a bad website. That's why I always strive to make accessible, user friendly applications that people will actually want to use. 

Outside of work, I love making games! You will find several of my game repo's here on my github page. My most popular project is **[Fruit Stand Fortune](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3306030/Fruit_Stand_Fortune/)**, available on **[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3306030/Fruit_Stand_Fortune/)** and **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ggg.fruitstandfortune)**. You can also find many of my other games on [Itch.io](https://gummygrenadegames.itch.io/).
